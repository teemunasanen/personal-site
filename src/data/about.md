# Intro

I have been involved in warehouse logistics for more than 15 years, including the last 10 years making night shifts in Kesko's frozen food warehouse. -26 ° C work environment, night shift, physical work ... well it was time to do something else and I started a big project for myself with the aim of changing fields.

# Studies

I am on study leave from warehouse work and I am studying Business Information Technology at [Laurea University of Applied Sciences](https://www.laurea.fi/en/). I completed 158 (of 210 total) credits with 4,67 grade point average in the first two years and this fall 2021 began my third year. I have taken a variety of courses to get a good idea of ​​the new field. The first year I studied in contact teaching and the second in distance learning. Laurea includes a lot of group work and small [projects](https://www.teemunasanen.com/projects)  where I feel I have learned real working life skills. My studies have included programming, databases, web and mobile development, and security courses ([Full list here](https://www.teemunasanen.com/resume#courses)). The next step is an internship and a thesis.
